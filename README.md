This Project is designed to process and enhance 2D curves represented by sequences of points. The core objectives include:

- **Curve Regularization**: Identify and standardize common geometric shapes like lines, circles, ellipses, rectangles, polygons, and stars.
  
- **Symmetry Exploration**: Detect and analyze reflectional and rotational symmetries within the curves.
  
- **Curve Completion**: Seamlessly fill gaps and connect disjoint segments of curves.

##  Input

- **CSV Files**: Curves are provided as sequences of points in CSV format.

---

##  Output

- **Composite Images**: Visual representations showcasing the identified shapes.
  
- **SVG Visualizations**: Detailed SVG files depicting the processed curve
